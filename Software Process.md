- A process is a collection of activities, actions and tasks that are performed when some work product is to be created

- A process is not a rigid prescription for how to build the software, rather it is adaptable approach that enables the people doing the work to pick and choose the appropriate set of work actions and tasks

- An activity try to achieve a broad objective (e.g., communication with stakeholders)
- An activity is applied regardless of the application domain, size of the project, complexity of the effort, or degree of accuracy with which software engineering is to be applied.

- An action (e.g., architectural design) encompasses a set of tasks that produce a major work product (e.g., an architectural design model).

- A task focuses on a small, but well-defined objective (e.g., conducting a unit test) that produces a noticeable outcome.

- Each of these activities, actions & tasks reside within a framework or model.

- Each framework activity is populated by set of software engineering actions

- Each software engineering action is defined by a task set that identifies work to be completed, product to be produced, quality assurance points & milestones to indicate progress

### Software Process Framework
#### The purpose of software process is
- to deliver software in timely manner and within sufficient quality to satisfy those

- Who has given proposal for software development and

- Those who will use software

### Umbrella Activities
- Umbrella activities applied throughout the software project & help a software team to manage and control progress, quality, change & risks.
- Umbrella activities are those which keep running in the background throughout the software development
- **It establish a skeleton architecture for software engineering work.**
- **Activities of Umbrella Activity**

- Software project tracking and control: allows the software team to assess progress against the project plan and take any necessary action to maintain the schedule.

- **Risk management:** assesses (evaluates) risks that may affect the outcome of the project or the quality of the product.

- **Software quality assurance:** defines and conducts the activities required to ensure software quality.

- **Technical reviews:** assesses software engineering work products in an effort to uncover and remove errors before they are propagated to the next activity.

- **Measurement:** defines and collects process, project and product measures that assist the team in delivering software that meets stakeholdersâ€™ needs.

- **Software configuration management:** it manages the effects of change throughout the software process.

- **Reusability management:** it defines criteria for work product reuse (including software components) and establishes mechanisms to achieve reusable components.

- **Work product preparation and production:** it encompasses (includes) the activities required to create work products such as models, documents, logs, forms and lists.
