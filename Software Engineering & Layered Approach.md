## Software Engineering
- Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently in real machines.
- Software Engineering is the science and art of building (designing and writing programs) a software systems that are:

1) on time

2) on budget

3) with acceptable performance

4) with correct operation

## Software Engineering layered Approach

1. A quality focus
	- Main principle of Software Engineering is Quality Focus.
	-  An engineering approach must have a focus on quality.
	- Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, ISO 9001, ISO 9000-3, CAPABILITY MATURITY MODEL (CMM), CMMI & similar approaches encourages a continuous process improvement culture.
2. Process 
	- It is a foundation of Software Engineering, It is the glue the holds the technology layers together and enables logical and timely development of computer software.
	- It defines a framework with activities for effective delivery of software engineering technology
	- It establish the context in which technical methods are applied, work products (models, documents, data, reports, forms, etc.) are produced, milestones are established, quality is ensured, and change is properly managed.
