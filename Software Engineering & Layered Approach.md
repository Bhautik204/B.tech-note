## Software Engineering
- Software engineering is the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to obtain economically software that is reliable and works efficiently in real machines.
- Software Engineering is the science and art of building (designing and writing programs) a software systems that are:

1) on time

2) on budget

3) with acceptable performance

4) with correct operation

## Software Engineering layered Approach

1. A quality focus
	- Main principle of Software Engineering is Quality Focus.
	-  An engineering approach must have a focus on quality.
	- Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, ISO 9001, ISO 9000-3, CAPABILITY MATURITY MODEL (CMM), CMMI & similar approaches encourages a continuous process improvement culture.
2. Process 
	- It is a foundation of Software Engineering, It is the glue the holds the technology layers together and enables logical and timely development of computer software.
	- It defines a framework with activities for effective delivery of software engineering technology
	- It establish the context in which technical methods are applied, work products (models, documents, data, reports, forms, etc.) are produced, milestones are established, quality is ensured, and change is properly managed.
3. Methods 
	 - It provides technical how-to’s for building software
	- It encompasses many tasks including communication, requirement analysis, design modeling, program construction, testing and support
1. Tools
    - Software engineering tools provide automated or semiautomated support for the process and the methods
	- Computer‐aided software engineering (CASE) is the scientific application of a set of tools and methods to a software system which is meant to result in high‐quality, defect‐free, and maintainable software products.
	- CASE tools automate many of the activities involved in various life cycle phases.
