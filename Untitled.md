    data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['City', 'Has Table Booking', 'Has Online Delivery'])
    ```

- **Multi-Label Binarizer for 'Cuisines'**:

  - Since a restaurant can have multiple cuisines, use `MultiLabelBinarizer`.

    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer

    data['Cuisines'] = data['Cuisines'].str.split(', ')

    mlb = MultiLabelBinarizer()
    cuisines_encoded = mlb.fit_transform(data['Cuisines'])

    cuisines_df = pd.DataFrame(cuisines_encoded, columns=mlb.classes_)
    data = pd.concat([data, cuisines_df], axis=1)
    data = data.drop('Cuisines', axis=1)
    ```

#### **1.4 Normalizing Numerical Features**

- **Scale Features**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

  scaler = MinMaxScaler()
  data[['Average Cost for Two', 'Price Range', 'Aggregate Rating', 'Votes']] = scaler.fit_transform(
      data[['Average Cost for Two', 'Price Range', 'Aggregate Rating', 'Votes']]
  )
  ```

---

### **2. Building the Feature Matrix**

- **Assemble Features**:

  Combine all the encoded categorical features and normalized numerical features into a single feature matrix.

  ```python
  feature_columns = [col for col in data.columns if col not in ['Restaurant ID', 'Restaurant Name', 'Address', 'Locality Verbose', 'Currency', 'Rating Color', 'Rating Text']]
  feature_matrix = data[feature_columns]
  ```

---

### **3. Computing Similarity**

#### **3.1 Choose a Similarity Measure**

- **Cosine Similarity** is preferred for high-dimensional sparse data.

#### **3.2 Calculate Similarity Matrix**

- **Using Sklearn**:

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

  similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(feature_matrix)
  ```

---

### **4. Creating the Recommendation Function**

#### **4.1 Define a Function**

Create a function that takes a restaurant name and outputs similar restaurants.

```python
def recommend_restaurants(restaurant_name, data, similarity_matrix, k=5):
    # Find the index of the restaurant
    idx = data[data['Restaurant Name'] == restaurant_name].index[0]

    # Get similarity scores
    sim_scores = list(enumerate(similarity_matrix[idx]))

    # Sort the restaurants based on similarity scores
    sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Get indices of k most similar restaurants
    sim_scores = sim_scores[1:k+1]  # Exclude the input restaurant itself

    restaurant_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]

    # Return the top k most similar restaurants
    return data.iloc[restaurant_indices][['Restaurant Name', 'City', 'Aggregate Rating', 'Average Cost for Two']]
```

#### **4.2 Example Usage**

```python
recommendations = recommend_restaurants('Restaurant XYZ', data, similarity_matrix, k=5)
print(recommendations)
```

---

### **5. Enhancing the Recommendations**

#### **5.1 Incorporate Location Filtering**

- **Same City or Locality**:

  Modify the function to filter recommendations within the same city or locality.

  ```python
  def recommend_restaurants_by_location(restaurant_name, data, similarity_matrix, k=5):
      idx = data[data['Restaurant Name'] == restaurant_name].index[0]
      target_city = data.iloc[idx]['City']

      sim_scores = list(enumerate(similarity_matrix[idx]))
      sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
      sim_scores = sim_scores[1:]  # Exclude the restaurant itself

      # Filter restaurants in the same city
      filtered_scores = [score for score in sim_scores if data.iloc[score[0]]['City'] == target_city]

      # Get the top k recommendations
      sim_scores = filtered_scores[:k]
      restaurant_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]

      return data.iloc[restaurant_indices][['Restaurant Name', 'City', 'Aggregate Rating', 'Average Cost for Two']]
  ```

#### **5.2 Adjusting for Popularity**

- **Weighted Recommendations**:

  Multiply similarity scores by the restaurant's aggregate rating to emphasize highly-rated options.

  ```python
  def recommend_weighted_restaurants(restaurant_name, data, similarity_matrix, k=5):
      idx = data[data['Restaurant Name'] == restaurant_name].index[0]
      sim_scores = list(enumerate(similarity_matrix[idx]))

      # Adjust scores with Aggregate Rating
      sim_scores = [(i, score * data.iloc[i]['Aggregate Rating']) for i, score in sim_scores]
      sim_scores = sorted(sim_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

      sim_scores = sim_scores[1:k+1]
      restaurant_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]

      return data.iloc[restaurant_indices][['Restaurant Name', 'Aggregate Rating', 'Average Cost for Two']]
  ```

### **6. Evaluating the Model**

#### **6.1 Manual Evaluation**

- **Check Relevance**:

  - Ensure that the recommended restaurants are similar in terms of cuisines, price range, and services.

- **Diversity**:

  - Verify that the recommendations aren't overly redundant.

#### **6.2 Potential Metrics**

While traditional recommendation system metrics require user interaction data, you can:

- **Assess Similarity Scores**:

  - Analyze the distribution of similarity scores.

- **Cross-Validation**:

  - If you have any temporal data, simulate a time-based split.

---

### **7. Visualization and Presentation**

#### **7.1 Visualizing Recommendations**

- **Table Format**:

  Display recommendations in a neat table with key attributes.

- **Geospatial Plots**:

  - Use `folium` or `geopandas` to map the locations of recommended restaurants.

    ```python
    import folium

    def plot_restaurants_on_map(restaurants):
        # Create a map centered around the first restaurant
        map_center = [restaurants.iloc[0]['Latitude'], restaurants.iloc[0]['Longitude']]
        m = folium.Map(location=map_center, zoom_start=13)

        for _, row in restaurants.iterrows():
            folium.Marker(
                [row['Latitude'], row['Longitude']],
                popup=row['Restaurant Name']
            ).add_to(m)
        return m

    map = plot_restaurants_on_map(data.iloc[restaurant_indices])
    map.save('recommendations_map.html')
    ```

#### **7.2 Interactive Demo**

- **Using Streamlit**:

  - Create an interactive web app where users can input a restaurant and see recommendations.

    ```python
    import streamlit as st

    st.title('Restaurant Recommendation System')

    restaurant_list = data['Restaurant Name'].unique()
    selected_restaurant = st.selectbox('Select a restaurant:', restaurant_list)

    if st.button('Recommend'):
        recommendations = recommend_restaurants(selected_restaurant, data, similarity_matrix)
        st.write(recommendations)
    ```

### **8. Extending the Project**

#### **8.1 Incorporate User Preferences**

- **Preference Input**:

  - Allow users to input preferred cuisines or price range.

- **Filter Recommendations**:

  - Adjust similarity scores or filter results based on these preferences.

#### **8.2 Hybrid Recommendation System**

- **Popularity-Based Recommendations**:

  - Recommend top restaurants based on Aggregate Rating and Votes as a baseline.

- **Combine with k-NN**:

  - Blend content-based recommendations with popularity to enhance results.

#### **8.3 Clustering for Enhanced Recommendations**

- **Cluster Restaurants**:

  - Use clustering algorithms to group similar restaurants.

    ```python
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10)
    data['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(feature_matrix)
    ```

- **Cluster-Based Recommendations**:

  - Recommend restaurants from the same cluster as the selected restaurant.

---

## **Best Practices and Considerations**

### **Data Quality**

- **Deduplication**:

  - Ensure there are no duplicate entries for restaurants.

- **Outlier Detection**:

  - Identify and handle anomalies in features like 'Average Cost for Two'.

### **Feature Importance**

- **Weighting Features**:

  - Assign weights to features based on their importance to the user.

  - For instance, if 'Cuisines' are more important than 'Price Range', adjust accordingly.

### **Scalability**

- **Optimizing Computations**:

  - For large datasets, compute similarities only when needed or use approximate methods.

- **Dimensionality Reduction**:

  - Apply techniques like PCA if the feature space becomes too large.

---

## **Conclusion**

Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors for your recommendation system allows you to leverage the rich features of your dataset to provide meaningful suggestions. By focusing on carefully preprocessing your data and thoughtfully constructing your recommendation algorithm, you can create a robust system that adds significant value.

---

## **Next Steps**

- **Prototype Development**:

  - Begin coding the recommendation system step by step, testing each component.

- **Experimentation**:

  - Try different values of 'k' and observe how it affects the recommendations.
