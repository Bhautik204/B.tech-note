Absolutely! Let's delve into the core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, focusing on their definitions, benefits, and examples in C#. OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and methods. The four main principles of OOP are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## 1. [[Encapsulation]]

## 2. [[Abstraction]]

## 3. [[Inheritance]]

## 4. [[Polymorphism]]
## 5. [[Constructors]]
## Summary

- **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods, protecting the internal state.
- **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details, showing only essential features.
- **Inheritance**: Reuses existing classes to create new ones, promoting code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility and reusability.
