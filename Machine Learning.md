## introduction
- 48% of business globally use ML
- 57% companies use ML to improve consumer experience
- 49% use for marketing 
## AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- technique which enables machines to mimic human behaviour.
## ML (Machine Learning)
- statistical methods to enables machine to improve with experience.
## DL (Deep Learning)
 - which make the computation of multi-layer neural network feasible.

| Traditional Programming                  | Machine Learning                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hard-coded rules                         | Data-Driven pattern                          |
| Rules are static, require manual updates | Dynamic,earns from data                      |
|                                          | Accuracy high, especially with quality data. |
|                                          | Lower Maintenance(after initial setup)       |
|                                          | Scales well with more data                   |
## Definition
1. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of task and performance measure P, if its performance at task in T , as measured by P, improve with experience E.**(Tom M. Mitchell 1997)**
2. ML is field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.**(Arthur Samuel 1959)**
