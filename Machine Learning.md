## introduction
- 48% of business globally use ML
- 57% companies use ML to improve consumer experience
- 49% use for marketing 
## AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- technique which enables machines to mimic human behaviour.
## ML (Machine Learning)
- statistical methods to enables machine to improve with experience.
## DL (Deep Learning)
 - which make the computation of multi-layer neural network feasible.

| Traditional Programming                  | Machine Learning                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hard-coded rules                         | Data-Driven pattern                          |
| Rules are static, require manual updates | Dynamic,earns from data                      |
|                                          | Accuracy high, especially with quality data. |
|                                          | Lower Maintenance(after initial setup)       |
|                                          | Scales well with more data                   |
## Definition
1. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of task and performance measure P, if its performance at task in T , as measured by P, improve with experience E.**(Tom M. Mitchell 1997)**
2. ML is field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.**(Arthur Samuel 1959)**

## Why use ML?

## When to use ML? 
- when it is an unstudied Phenomenon.
- When it is cost-effective.
- 
## When not to use ML
- decision made by it must be explainable.
- cost of an error made by system is too high.
- getting right data is too hard or impossible.
- solve problem using traditional software development at a lower cost.
- heuristic would work reasonably well.
- build system that will not have to be improved frequently over time.

## ML terminology
- **Algorithm:** A method, function,or series of instruction used to generate a machine learning model.
- **Model:** Mathematical representation of real-world process learned from data.
	- A model defined relationship between features and label.
	- Model are created/learned when you train an algorithm on dataset.
